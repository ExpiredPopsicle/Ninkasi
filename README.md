FAQ
---

1. Why the hell would I use this instead of Lua?
  * You probably shouldn't, but because you asked: No stupid one-based
    indexing. Superior semicolons and curly braces instead of blocks
    that end in weird ways depending on what started them. The ability
    to (relatively) trivially serialize and deserialize the entire VM
    state. (TODO) Easy sandboxing and hosting-application-defined
    memory usage limits.

2. Why did you make this when so many other better languages exist?
  * Seemed like a good idea at the time. May have also been a bit
    drunk.

3. Why the DOS compatibility stuff?
  * I was making a DOS game.

4. Is it fast?
  * Not particularly. Limited speed tests put it at about 1/10th the
    speed of Lua for an extremely simple program.

5. Are you drunk right now?
  * Almost certainly.
