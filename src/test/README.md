This directory contains the Ninkasi test system.

Beware of this code. It's rather messy.

"subtest.c" contains a full example of a custom user data type
implementation. It demonstrates external data types, serialization,
deserialization, garbage collection, error handling, external
reference handling, creation, and destruction.

"test.c" is just an incoherent mess of testing code. You have been
warned.
